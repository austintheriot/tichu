# Tichu

## About

Tichu is an adaptation of the Chinese game *Zheng Fen* by Urs Hostettler and was released in 1991. It is a strategically complex game and is quite addicting. Watch out if you ever learn it! It might leave you reluctant to play other card games...

Copyright of this game belongs to the original publisher of Tichu, and I do not claim any copyright on the underlying material/mechanics of the game. This project was made for educational purposes onlyâ€”namely that of learning Rust.
